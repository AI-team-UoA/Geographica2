# Geographica 2 Benchmark
> Evaluating Geospatial RDF stores Using the Benchmark Geographica 2

Geographica 2 improves the [Geographica](https://geographica.di.uoa.gr/) benchmark by adding one more workload, extending the existing workloads and evaluating 5 more RDF stores. Using three different real world workloads, Geographica 2 tests the efficiency of primitive spatial functions in RDF stores and their performance in real use case scenarios, a more detailed evaluation is performed using a synthetic workload and the scalability of the RDF stores is stressed with the scalability workload. In total eight systems are evaluated out of which six adequately support GeoSPARQL and two offer limited spatial support.

Documentation for the project is maintained at our [Geographica 2 web site](https://geographica2.di.uoa.gr/).
